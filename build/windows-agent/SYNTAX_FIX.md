# PowerShell Syntax Fix

## Problem
The `Complete-Reinstall.ps1` script had PowerShell syntax errors with variable interpolation containing colons.

## Error Messages
```
Unexpected token ':${portalPort}' in expression or statement.
Missing closing ')' in expression.
```

## Root Cause
PowerShell was having trouble parsing `${relayHost}:${portalPort}` syntax even with braces.

## Solution Applied
Changed from:
```powershell
Write-Host "   • Testing Portal API (${relayHost}:${portalPort})..." -ForegroundColor Gray -NoNewline
```

To:
```powershell
Write-Host "   • Testing Portal API ($relayHost`:$portalPort)..." -ForegroundColor Gray -NoNewline
```

## Quick Fix Instructions
If you need to manually fix the script on Windows:

1. Open `Complete-Reinstall.ps1` in Notepad or PowerShell ISE
2. Find line ~143: `Write-Host "   • Testing Portal API (${relayHost}:${portalPort})..."`
3. Replace with: `Write-Host "   • Testing Portal API ($relayHost`:$portalPort)..."`
4. Find line ~155: `Write-Host "   • Testing Relay Server (${relayHost}:${relayPort})..."`  
5. Replace with: `Write-Host "   • Testing Relay Server ($relayHost`:$relayPort)..."`
6. Save the file

## Files Updated
- ✅ `Complete-Reinstall.ps1` - Fixed variable interpolation
- ✅ `Simple-Reinstall.ps1` - No changes needed (uses hardcoded IPs)
- ✅ `Check-Status.ps1` - No changes needed (no problematic syntax)

## Status
✅ **FIXED** - Ready for installation
